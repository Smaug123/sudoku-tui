# sudoku

A [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) app for playing Sudoku.
This is a playground for me learning how to use LLMs better: I am having the LLMs write as much as possible.
My primary source is Claude Sonnet 3.5 (end of 2024 edition).

Accordingly, do not expect this code to be either idiomatic or correct, because I can't really judge either of those (I'm not experienced in Rust).

See the [claude-transcript](./claude-transcript.md) file for a description of how I used the LLMs.
